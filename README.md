# Stat 244: Computing for Statistics and Data Science with Julia
{: .mb-2 }
UC Berkeley
{: .mb-0 .fs-6 .text-grey-dk-000 }



## Offerings

1. [Spring 2025](/spring-2025)




## Overview

Programming and computation for applications in statistics, data science and related fields, focusing on the use of Julia, a modern language that offers interactivity with high performance based on just-in-time compilation. The course will also cover the use of co-processors, in particular GPUs, through Julia and Python packages such as Jax and PyTorch. Topics will include data types, functional programming, multiple argument dispatch, memory use, efficiency, parallelization, robustness and testing. 


## Logistics

Three hours of lecture per week for seven weeks. 

## Prerequisites

Statistics 243 or Statistics 215A or equivalent background of (1) extensive experience with a language such as Python or R, (2) basic familiarity with programming concepts such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, variable scope, memory use, and data structures, and (3) familiarity with the basics of parallel processing.
